# RC522 Test
In this project, I tested the RC522 module. I was based on a library unknown to me at the moment :(. 
Support for MiFare cards, unfortunately, requires first of all knowledge about the organization of memory in them. 
Therefore, before using this code, I recommend that you at least familiarize yourself with the memory organization in such cards. 
Connections as in CubeMX. 
Library should be be easily portable to other devices, also microcontrollers. In the project here, you can use a debugger to verify readings etc.
